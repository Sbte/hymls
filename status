Status HYMLS

can solve bordered systems
basically included 'full conservation tubes' (cf. parameter "Classifier"->"Stokes",
but the feature only works in certain cases (e.g. 2-level and 32^3, 3-level sx=4)

To be done
Acceleration of convergence as in MATLAB using a better appromation of the Schur Complement
on Stokes almost a factor 2 was gained.

It runs on Huygens, Millipede, in general on gnu systems.

Faster direct solver is underway

To be done
Acceleration of convergence as in MATLAB using a better appromation of the Schur Complement
on Stokes almost a factor 2 was gained.
Incorporation of border, as in MATLAB version. Needed for eigenvalue computation

bugs

unit test stokes3.xml (1-level/direct) fails if "Number of factorizations" 
or "Number of refinements" is increased
