Status HYMLS

can solve bordered systems
new ordering eliminates 'full conservation tubes' (cf. parameter "Preconditioner"->"Classifier"="Stokes",

To be done

Superludist tends to hang on Huygens, very annoying

Acceleration of convergence as in MATLAB using a better appromation of the Schur Complement
on Stokes almost a factor 2 was gained.

convergence criterion for GMRES should be independent of scaling of Grad and Div,
we would like to use ||(Ax_u-Gx_p) - f_u|| instead of ||Kx-f||, for instance. This
is a bit tricky to implement because Belos::BlockGmresSolMgr does not support
user-defined status tests, so we need to fix it up.

It runs on Huygens, Millipede, in general on gnu systems.

Faster direct solver is underway

To be done
Acceleration of convergence as in MATLAB using a better appromation of the Schur Complement
on Stokes almost a factor 2 was gained.
Incorporation of border, as in MATLAB version. Needed for eigenvalue computation

bugs

unit test stokes3.xml (1-level/direct) fails if "Number of factorizations" 
or "Number of refinements" is increased
