Status HYMLS

29 March 2012
It runs on Huygens, Millipede, in general on gnu systems.

Faster direct solver is underway

To be done
Acceleration of convergence as in MATLAB using a better appromation of the Schur Complement
on Stokes almost a factor 2 was gained.
Incorporation of border, as in MATLAB version. Needed for eigenvalue computation

bugs

unit test stokes3.xml (1-level/direct) fails if "Number of factorizations" 
or "Number of refinements" is increased
