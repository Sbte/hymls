Status HYMLS

It runs on Huygens, Millipede, in general on gnu systems.

Faster direct solver is underway

To be done
Acceleration of convergence as in MATLAB using a better appromation of the Schur Complement
on Stokes almost a factor 2 was gained.
Incorporation of border, as in MATLAB version. Needed for eigenvalue computation
